Functions used in Rotapy involving the parsing of user-based data.

yes_no: Returns True if Yes, False if No

make_choice_list: Prints a prompt and a list of choices for the user to select
                  from, and returns the user's selection. From a list.

make_choice_dict: Prints a prompt and a list of choices for the user to select
                  from, and returns the user's selection. From a dictionary.

make_output_folder: Makes a directory in the script location to output the downloaded files

parse_opt_geom_from_log: Given a .log file which contains an optimized geometry,
                         extract the (x,y,z) cartesian coordinates.

write_job_to_com: Takes in a list of atoms and their cartesian coordinates such as in parse_opt_geom_from_log,
                  and saves the coordinates to a .com file.
